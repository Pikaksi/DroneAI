The goal is to make drones that can move on their own to target locations. The drones are can only move by controlling the thrust and direction of two thrusters.

Drones are trained with a evolutionary model. Neural networks start off random, but as training progresses succesfull networks are prioritized and overtime the drones become evolve.
